# Some Golang Basic

- package layout more like java
    - directory name should match package name
- built-in github dependency/package support
- No generics
- Golang has interface, but match interface by duck typing
    - no inheritant
- Golang has struct, but no class
    - associate method outside struct
- Golang is not so OO
